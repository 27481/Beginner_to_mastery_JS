Array destructuring in JavaScript is a feature that allows you to unpack values from arrays or iterable objects into separate variables. It provides a concise way to extract elements from an array and assign them to variables in a single statement. This can make your code cleaner and more readable.


Here's the basic syntax of array destructuring:


const [variable1, variable2, ...rest] = array;

variable1, variable2, etc. 
are the variables where you want to assign the values from the array.


array is the source array or iterable object that you want to destructure.
...rest is an optional variable that collects the remaining elements into an array.
