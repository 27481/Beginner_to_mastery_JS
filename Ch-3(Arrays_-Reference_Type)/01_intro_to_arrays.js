//! intro to arrays 

// arrays are reference type 
//! Arrays -> arrays are ordered collection of items
//! In JavaScript, arrays can store elements of different data types within the same array, unlike languages like C++ where arrays typically store elements of the same data type. This flexibility in JavaScript arrays allows you to create heterogeneous arrays that can hold numbers, strings, objects, and other data types all in one array.


// how to create arrays 
let fruits =["apple","mango","grapes",1];
let numbers=[1,2,3,4];
let mixed=[1,2,3,4,"string",null,undefined];
console.log(fruits);
