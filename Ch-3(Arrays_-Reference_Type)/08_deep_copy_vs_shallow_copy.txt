The methods listed in your previous message are primarily used for shallow copying of arrays and objects in JavaScript. 
Shallow copying means that while the outer structure of the array or object is cloned, the elements within it are still references to the original elements. 
If you have nested arrays or objects, these methods will not create completely independent copies of the nested elements; instead, they will share references with the originals.

To achieve deep copying, where all nested arrays and objects are also cloned and not shared with the original, you would typically need to use a method like the custom recursive function or a library like Lodash's cloneDeep() function, as mentioned in my previous responses.






Here's a brief summary:

Methods like the spread operator ([...]), Array.from(), Array.prototype.slice(), and Array.prototype.concat() are suitable for shallow copying.

Methods like JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() can be used for deep copying but are limited to JSON-serializable data and cannot handle functions or objects with non-standard properties.
For a reliable and comprehensive deep copy, it's recommended to use a custom recursive function or a library like Lodash's cloneDeep() function.
