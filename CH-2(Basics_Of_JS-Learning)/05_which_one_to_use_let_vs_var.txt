Using the var keyword in javascript to declare variables is not recommended 
because it has (functional scope), not block scope 

.This can lead to unexpected behaviour and bugs in your codes

Its better to use let and const introduced in ES6, as they have block scope 
and provide better control over variable scoping making our code more predictable 
and maintainable


using `var` keyword is not recommended in moredern JS 
for several reasons:



1> Function Scope -> Variables delcared with  `var` have function-level block scope, 
                     not block-levle scope 
            This means they are not limited to the block in which they are defined 
            leading to potential issues and confusion 
    
    eg=> 
      function exampleFunction(){
        if(true){
            let x=10;
        }
        console.log(x); // Output 10, even though x was declared inside the if block
      }


2> hoisiting behaviour =>
                    Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This can lead to unexpected behavior when variables are used before they are declared.

                    eg=> 
                    console.log(myVar); // undefined (not an error)
                    var myVar = 10;


3> No Block Scope  ==> var does not respect block-level scope, which can make code 
less predictable and lead to unintentional variable shadowing.


function example() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;
    }
    // 'x' is still accessible here, which may not be intended
}



4> let and const Alternatives ==> In modern JavaScript, let and const provide block-level scope, making code more predictable and reducing the likelihood of bugs. They are considered safer and more flexible alternatives to var



In summary, 
it's recommended to use let and const for variable declarations 
In modern JavaScript code 
   because they offer better scoping and are less error-prone compared to var. var is still supported for backward compatibility but is no longer the preferred way to declare variables in most JavaScript applications.
