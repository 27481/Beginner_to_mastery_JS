"use strict";

/*
The "use strict" directive enables JavaScript's strict mode. JavaScript's strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime. It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

//! intro to variables 

// variables can store some information 
// we can use that information later 
// we can change that information later 

// declare a variable 


//! declaring a variable 
var firstName = "Utkarsh";

// using a variable 
console.log(firstName);

// change value 
var firstname="Utkarsh_Pandey";
console.log(firstname);

//! we can declare variable without without using var keyword but it will lead undefined results
