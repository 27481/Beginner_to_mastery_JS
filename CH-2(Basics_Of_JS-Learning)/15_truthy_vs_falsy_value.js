Exactly! You've got it. 

Truthy and falsy values are used to determine the Boolean evaluation of an expression or condition in JavaScript. This is particularly useful in constructs like if statements and logical operations (&&, ||) where you want to check whether a value is considered true or false in a Boolean context.

As you mentioned, null is a falsy value, so an if statement with the condition if (v) would evaluate to false if v is null, undefined, 0, or any other falsy value. Conversely, if v holds a truthy value like a non-empty string, a number other than 0, or an object, the if statement would evaluate to true.

This concept is fundamental in JavaScript and is used extensively in conditionals and other decision-making parts of code to control program flow based on whether values are considered true or false in a Boolean context.z
