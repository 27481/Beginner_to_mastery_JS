JavaScript has several built-in data types. These data types can be broadly categorized into two main categories: 

(primitive data types and reference data types)

Primitive Data Types:

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as text.

Boolean: Represents true or false values.

Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.

Symbol (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique and immutable value primarily used as object property keys.

BigInt (introduced in ECMAScript 11): Represents large integers that can't be represented using the Number type.
Reference Data Types:

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, often used to represent complex data structures.


Array: A specialized type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
Function: A callable object that can execute a block of code.

Date: Represents dates and times.

RegExp: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.

Map : (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Represents a collection of key-value pairs with predictable iteration order.

Set : (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Represents a collection of unique values.
WeakMap : (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Similar to Map but with some differences in key references.

WeakSet : (introduced in ECMAScript 6): Similar to Set but with some differences in object references.



These are the fundamental data types in JavaScript. 

Understanding these data types is essential for effective programming in JavaScript, as they form the building blocks for storing and manipulating data in the language.
