Objects 

arrays are good but not sufficent 
for real world data 
object store key value pairs 
objects dont have index 



In JavaScript, 
object keys are stored as strings by default. 
This means that when you create an object and specify keys, those keys are automatically converted to strings, even if you provide them as other data types like numbers or symbols.
